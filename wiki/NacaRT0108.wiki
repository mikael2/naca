=== Details of the loaded copy (Copy.xxx) ===

 Each Copy file has a MBean JMX definition.
 We are displaying the number of programs that are dependant on the Copy.
 We can unload a Copy.
 This will result in unloading all the programs that are using the Copy.
 This must not be done for Copy that are massively used (type ERRZONE), because the system will be locked when all the programs using ERRZONE will be unloaded.
 The performances will suffer a lot.
 However, if a Copy is used only by a few programs, and if they are not or nearly not running at this time, then the time response time will not or will not so much be impacted.
 The update procedure at runtime is:
  * Put the new Copy file in the folder identified by the variable {{{ApplicationClassPath}}} in the configuration file.
  * Request an {{{unloadProgram}}} using the JMX interface.
