== Configuration ==

 Convention used here: Naca trans can be installed anywhere.
 However, for example reason it's supposed to be installed in a Windows development computer at D:\Dev\Naca\NacaTrans directory.
 All the paths provided in this document will refer to this directory.

=== File location ===

 The configuration of the NacaTrans is done through the NacaTrans.cfg file. It must be located at the projet's root.
 For example, if the standard path is used (D:\Dev\Naca\NacaTrans), then the configuration file is then D:\Dev\Naca\NacaTrans\NacaTrans.cfg.
 It's an XML file.

=== NacaTrans execution command line ===

 NacaTrans doesn't need any command line argument.

 The easiest way to run it is to launch Eclispe, and import the NacaTrans projet in the workspace.
 You will also need to import the JLib projet. They are both in the zip file of the Naca Open Source package.
 JLib is a library used internally by the transcoder.

 Then, create a new Debug/Run configuration with Projet set to "NacaTrans" and Main class set to "NacaTrans".
 That's it !

 However, before running it, the configuration file NacaTrans.cfg must be filled in.
