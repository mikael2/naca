 Initialisation:
 
  In main file:

   {{{
   Log.open("Test", "D:/Dev/JLogWriterTest/src/net/publigroupe/config/Logging.ini", "Run1", "Crawler");
   }}}

   * Test is the channel; it must match items in ini configuation file.
   * D:/Dev/JLogWriterTest/src/net/publigroupe/config/Logging.ini: Is the path to the configuration file.
   * Run1 identifies the run id; It is used to group chained processes.
   * Crawler identifies the product.
     This call will result in a LogEventStartProcess event to be sent.

 If progress execution is to be logged, the following will be done:

  {{{
  Log.LogEventProgress.log("Test", nNbItemProcessed, nNbItemToProcess, "Process in way ...");
  }}}

 After processing of all items:

  {{{
  Log.LogEventProgress.log("Test", nNbItemProcessed, nNbItemSuccessfullyProcessed, "Process done");
  }}}

 To report the previously defined custom log event LogEventEndCrawl call:

  {{{
  LogEventEndCrawl.log(csDomainUrl, nElpasedTimeInMilliseconds, "Domain crawled");
  }}}

  There is no need to provide the channel id, as it is already specified in the LogEventEndCrawl log method.

 Before launching a child process, we identifies the child process name:

  {{{
  LogEventLaunchProcess.log("Test", "ChildProcess", "Lauching analyser process");
  }}}

 In the child process, we will find:

  {{{
  Log.open("Test", "D:/Dev/JLogWriterTest/src/net/publigroupe/config/Logging.ini", "ChildRunId", "Crawler");
  }}}

  The field "RunId" has the value "ChildRunId"; this will enable the logviewer to connect these 2 processes.
