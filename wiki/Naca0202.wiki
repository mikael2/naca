= Naca - Whitepaper - Transcoding and runtime concepts =

== Transcoding process ==

 Transcoding is automatic and 99% of time does not require configuration file.
 The transcoder automatically reports when it needs a specific configuration file for a given program.

 Transcoding process:

 Naca deals with Java code generation and execution.

 The generated code thus must meet some strong points.

 The generated java uses a Cobol-like syntax.
 It's as close as possible from original Cobol syntax, within of course the limits of the Java language.

 Generated code doesn't look like classical native java and is not object oriented from the application point of view.

 This is a by design strong choice, to enable a smooth migration of Cobol developers to the Java environment.
 The goal is to keep business knowledge in the hand of people who wrote the original Cobol programs.

 All Java transcoded programs must sports the following characteristics:

  * Maintainable by the Cobol team
  * Give similar results as original code
  * Achieve at least similar performance response time as their host origins
  * Application monitoring and statistics

== Maintenance ==

 Human maintenance implies that Java generated programs have the following characteristics:

  * They are humanly readable.
  * The Java generated code is to be maintained by trained Cobol developers, with a thin leaning curve of the Java environment and tools.
    They are not intended to be maintained by trained Java developers.
  * Transcoded program must achieve a 1 to 1 line matching with the Cobol program.
    This implies that they are not object oriented, and that the original line ordering is kept.
  * A maximum of code checking must be done at compilation time, not at runtime.
    This guarantees a maximum correctness of a program, even when it's maintained manually.
  * SQL statements must be directly visible in the source code, as is the case in MVS Cobol.
    It's technically dynamic SQL, but syntaxically looks like static SQL.
  * They must be testable easily.
  * Central compilation, or during development, in a developer workstation's Eclipse is required.
  * They can be debugged in an Eclipse environment within the developer's computer.
  * Remote debugging must be supported.
  * Execution must provide at least the same error diagnostics as the Cobol root.
    In fact, better diagnostics are offered, for example by checking at runtime if a given occurs index is in the validity range.

== Results correctness ==

 This is achieved by the following rules:

  * Transcoded programs are a direct transcription of the Cobol source, using Java syntax instead of Cobol syntax.
  * The NacaRT library provides a software layer that emulates a complete Cobol runtime, with all it's specificities.
    This is the key point that guarantees similar execution.

== Performances ==

 Performances are achieved by the using following techniques:

  * NacaRT handles many caches for a lot of internal resources. The following resources are strongly cached. For example:
    *  Programs and program instances
    *  Variables
    *  SQL connections, statements, resultset columns, ?
       In fact, SQL is very deeply cached, with more than 5 levels of caching.
  * Screen IO requires CPU intensive XSL transform. These transforms are in fact compiled once for during the 1st program instance execution, and reused later.
  * Online programs sessions are naturally executed concurrently. Each session runs in it's own private thread.
    Thus, the whole system benefits directly form modern multi-core CPU architetures.
  * Batch program are sequential and mono-threaded by nature. However, internal or external sorting are multi-threaded to achieve good results.
    File accesses are cached in NacaRT, on top of Java JRE own cache, which itself lives on top of the OS own file system cache.
  * Java JRE >= 1.5 is mature and it's various memory management pools are efficient.
  * Garbage collection is sometimes a blocking operation done at will by Java JRE.
    It's not possible to avoid completely these steps, but a lot is done in NacaRT to keep and reuse objects as often as possible.
    This helps limiting these kinds of blocking garbage collections. However, a fine tuning of the JVM parameters has to be set.

== SQL Support and characters encoding ==

=== Database ===

 MVS Cobol targets a DB2 database, and uses EBCDIC character set.

 Java uses internally Unicode UTF-16 character representation, which is completely different from EBCDIC.
 Transcoded programs may be run using a mainframe DB2 instance, or a UDB instance.
 UDB can be setup in a selectable character encoding.
 However, the recommendations are to use Unicode UTF-16 character sets.

=== Batch files ===

 The same situation occurs for batches.
 Host needs ECBDIC, while Naca must support either ASCII or EBCDIC encodings.

 Note:ASCII is a subset of Unicode UTF-16.

=== NacaRT support ===

 NacaRT provide a mean to deal with these various character representations.
 Internally, everything is based upon Java standard, UTF-16.

 When reading or writing data to a database, the database driver does automatically the required conversions at runtime.

 When reading or writing data to a file, NacaRT file access layer does also the required conversions at runtime.
 It takes care to convert only required fields, depending on their Cobol type as described in the program source code.
 For example, numeric encoded comp-3 fields must not be converted, as their value does not depend on their character set.

 This is a powerful mechanism that covers all required conversions aspects, even in external sort.

 For example, it's possible to sort an EBCDIC file by using ASCII comparisons, if required.

 External sorting uses collating sequences to compare key-segments in the required representation.

=== Monitoring ===

 Transcoded online programs are executed in a Tomcat container, that hosts Java JMX (Java Management eXtensions) services.
 NacaRT adds various JMX Mbeans components that permits the following remote operations, through a JMX console:

  * Checking memory, threads and loaded classes usage.
  * Access to NacaRT general statistics, showing for example:
    * Number of active cached DB connections.
    * Number of active cached prepared SQL statements.
    * Number of correctly executed transactions.
    * Number of erroneously executed transactions.
    * Number of loaded programs.
    * Number of currently running programs.
  * Application site can be closed or open at will, or by using a planed open/close calendar.
  * Log settings can be updated.

 Another important source of statistics is provided by registration in a central DB of a record when an Online transaction is run, and when it's terminated.
 This in-DB transaction log provides a mean to bill transactions.
