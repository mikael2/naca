=== Presentation screen ressources (_ XSLTResources) ===

 To be used in transactional mode only.

 Displays the number of transformation files loaded in specialized compiled objects for XSLT transformations.
 We can request to unload them from the memory.
 The next HTML screen production will reload the transformation files.
 The request will be handled asynchronously, depending on the system load.
 This is allowing the modification of one or more ressources files and to see the effect on the presentation screens without restarting Tomcat.
 
 The update procedure is:
  * Put the new transformation file identified by the variable {{{XSLFilePath}}} or {{{HelpXSLFilePath}}} or {{{PSXSLFilePath}}} in the configuration file.
  * Request the unload of the pooled ressources.
