 This document states that naca-x.y.z.zip has been unzipped in {{{D:\Dev\naca}}} directory.
 All configuration paths are set on this directory by default.
 It can be changed, but with more efforts.

 To transcode Naca sample Cobol files, you need to launch NacaTrans with the following parameters:

  Project: NacaTrans
  Main class: NacaTrans
  Command line argument: {{{D:\Dev\naca\NacaSamples\trans\NacaTransSamples.cfg}}}
  The details of this configuration file is explained in NacaSampleTranscodingUsage.pdf file.

 After transcoding, the following directories are created:

  {{{D:\Dev\naca\NacaSamples\src}}}: containing genenrated java files
  {{{D:\Dev\naca\NacaSamples\trans\info\ItemCount.html}}}: file giving statistics on various verbs, constructions, ...
  {{{D:\Dev\naca\NacaSamples\trans\stat}}}: Contains temporary files used during transcoding
